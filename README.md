# LgbmEx

LgbmEx is a wrapper library for microsoft/LightGBM (partical) cli, C-API implemented by Elixir.

**NOTE**

- Beta version / Not stable
- Building model uses CLI command
- Prediction uses C-API


## Sample

```elixir

features_train = [
  [5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2],
  [4.9, 3.0, 1.4, 0.2],
  [4.7, 3.2, 1.3, 0.2],
  [4.6, 3.1, 1.5, 0.2],
  [5.0, 3.6, 1.4, 0.2],
  [7.0, 3.2, 4.7, 1.4],
  [6.4, 3.2, 4.5, 1.5],
  [6.9, 3.1, 4.9, 1.5],
  [5.5, 2.3, 4.0, 1.3],
  [6.5, 2.8, 4.6, 1.5],
  [6.3, 3.3, 6.0, 2.5],
  [5.8, 2.7, 5.1, 1.9],
  [7.1, 3.0, 5.9, 2.1],
  [6.3, 2.9, 5.6, 1.8],
  [6.5, 3.0, 5.8, 2.2]
]

labels_train = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

features = [
  [5.4, 3.9, 1.7, 0.4],
  [5.7, 2.8, 4.5, 1.3],
  [7.6, 3.0, 6.6, 2.1]
]

tmp_dir = System.tmp_dir
model = Lgbm_ex.new_model(tmp_dir)
model = LgbmEx.fit(features_train, labels_train, [
  objective: "multiclass",
  metric: "multi_logloss",
  num_class: 3,
  num_iterations: 10,
  num_leaves: 5,
  min_data_in_leaf: 1
])

LgbmEx.predict(model, features)
```


## Instration

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:lgbm_ex, "0.0.1", github: "/tato-gh/lgbm_ex"}
  ]
end
```

- Probably does not work on os x. Docker recommended.
