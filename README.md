# LgbmEx

LgbmEx is a wrapper library for microsoft/LightGBM (partical) cli, C-API implemented by Elixir.

**NOTE**

- Beta version / Not stable
- The building of the model uses CLI commands.
  - This means using a disk for model and data storage.
- Prediction uses the C-API.


## Sample

```elixir

# Please set environment LGBM_EX_WORKDIR for the working disk space, otherwise, uses `System.tmp_dir()/lgbm_ex`

{_mapping, df} = Explorer.Datasets.iris() |> LgbmEx.preproccessing_label_encode("species")

model =
  LgbmEx.fit("model_directory_name", df, "species",
    objective: "multiclass",
    metric: "multi_logloss",
    num_class: 3,
    num_iterations: 20
  )

x_test =
 [
   [5.4, 3.9, 1.7, 0.4],
   [5.7, 2.8, 4.5, 1.4],
   [7.6, 3.0, 6.6, 2.2]
 ]

LgbmEx.predict(model, x_test)
```


## Instration

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:lgbm_ex, "0.0.2", github: "/tato-gh/lgbm_ex"}
  ]
end
```

- Probably does not work on os x. Docker recommended.
